# 88. Merge Sorted Array

- Hint: Use two pointers from the end of `nums1` and `nums2` to place the largest value at the back of `nums1`.

## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

## Examples

### Example 1

- Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`
- Output: `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1,2,3]` and `[2,5,6]`. The result is `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`.

### Example 2

- Input: `nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0`
- Output: `[1]`
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1]` and `[]`. The result is `[1]`.

### Example 3

- Input: `nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1`
- Output: `[1]`
- Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[]` and `[1]`. Since `m = 0`, there are no valid elements in `nums1`; the `0` is only placeholder space.

## Constraints

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

## Follow-up

Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
